# US Retail Sales From 1992 until 2022 Data Analysis
This ongoing project involves the exploration, cleaning, and analysis of data obtained from census.gov. Our primary goal is to uncover trends and insights within the data that can provide valuable information about various demographic aspects.

### Project Overview

In this project, we are working with data collected from census.gov, a reliable source for demographic data. The data contains information about different aspects of the population, such as age, education, occupation, gender, and more. Our project is divided into several key phases:

### Data Collection 
We sourced our data from census.gov, ensuring that we have a comprehensive and representative dataset.

### Data Cleaning and Reshaping

One of the initial and crucial steps in our project is to clean and reshape the data. This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, ensuring data consistency, and reshaping the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA
With cleaned data, we are performing exploratory analysis to identify patterns, trends, and potential insights. We have already generated some initial graphs to visualize certain aspects of the data.

### Current Status

As of the current date (2023-08-14), we are actively working on the project. We have made progress in data cleaning and have generated several graphs to visualize preliminary findings. The data analysis phase is ongoing, and we anticipate discovering more interesting trends as we delve deeper into the dataset.

### Future Steps

While the project is still in progress, our next steps include:
- Conducting in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden insights.
- Applying statistical techniques to validate any trends observed.
- Developing predictive models to forecast potential outcomes based on the demographic data.
- Creating a comprehensive report detailing our findings and insights.

### Get Involved

We encourage collaboration and welcome contributions from fellow data enthusiasts and analysts. If you're interested in joining our efforts, feel free to fork this repository and contribute your expertise. Together, we can enhance the quality of the analysis and generate valuable insights from the census data.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to work on this exciting project!

**Note:** This project is inspired by various data analysis projects on GitHub, such as [Holarkunbi's Census Analysis](https://github.com/Holarkunbi/Census_analysis/blob/data_cleaning/README.md), [USCensusAnalysis](https://github.com/cjblackout/USCensusAnalysis), and [Predicting the Income Level - U.S. Census Data](https://github.com/Raj6383/Predicting-the-Income-Level--U.S-census-data). For the technical parts, I drew inspiration from aticles on reshaping data using Pandas melt function[[1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reshaping-pandas-dataframes-using-melt-and-unmelt/)][[2](https://towardsdatascience.com/reshaping-a-dataframe-using-pandas-melt-83a151ce1907)][[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-melt/)]. These projects showcase the diverse applications of data analysis in exploring census data.
